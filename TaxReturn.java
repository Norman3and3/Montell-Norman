/*
Problem Defintion
Create a TaxReturn class with fields that hold a taxpayerâ€™s Social Security number, last name, first name, street address, city, zip code, marital status, annual income, and tax liability. 
Include a constructor that requires arguments that provides values for all the fields other than the tax liability. 
Then calculate the tax liability based on annual income and the percentage shown below:
Income               Single                Married 
0-20,000              15%                    14% 
20,001-50,000         22%                    20% 
50,001 and over       30%                    28% 
In the TaxReturn class, also include a display method that displays all the TaxReturn data. 
Save the file as TaxReturn.java.

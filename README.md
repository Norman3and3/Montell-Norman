This README file is for the Quiz.java file and this program is all about creating a GUI application that quizzes the user on their knowledge on certain subjects.
The import method helps the program with making the GUI object or textbox that will appear in the output screen as shown:

This textbox will prompt the user to answer three questions with four options as answers. Now the string method is used here to help keep each answer and questions to be called in
later in the program. 
Now the GUI panel code will use a method call JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(); which will display the textbox with the question and the answers. It tells the user what is about 
to happen on screen.
Afterward, we use the input method to get the user's answer and that's where the while loop comes in. The while loops will check and see if the user has entered in the correct data
and if not then they are prompted with an ERROR/INCORRECT screen that will tell them in the following:

If the user enters in the correct data, then the textbox will output the following:

This will add the total number of correct answers the user has gotten and at the end of the program the user will get the following textbox that tells them how many they have
gotten right and how many they have gotten wrong with the percentage as well:
